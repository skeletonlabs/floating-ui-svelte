## Changesets

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) are used to automatically generate the changelog for each release. Any contributions made to projects that live within the `/lib` directory must contain a Changeset. Use the following instructions to generate a changeset.

1. Make sure you're within local pull request feature branch.
2. Navigate to the root of the project.
3. Run `pnpm changeset` to trigger the Changeset CLI.
4. Follow the instructions when prompted.
5. Changeset are added to the `/.changeset` directory.
6. Commit and push the new changeset file.

Changesets use semantic version. We recommend the following convention.

| Version | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `major` | Do not use. Reserved for maintainers. |
| `minor` | For notable changes, such as a new features. |
| `patch` | For small changes, such as a chore or typo. |

Changeset descriptions will appear verbatim on the [Changelog](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/blob/dev/packages/skeleton/CHANGELOG.md). Keep it short, semantic, and prefix this like branch names.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only add a changeset when the change affects the library, documentation changes for example will not require a changeset.
