## Changsets

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to automatically create our changelog per each release. Any changes or additions to the Library assets in `/lib` must be documented with a new Changeset. This can be done as follows:

2. Navigate to the root of the project on your feature branch.
3. Run `pnpm changeset` to trigger the Changeset CLI.
4. Follow the instructions when prompted.
    - Changesets should be either `minor` or `patch`. Never `major`.
    - Prefix your Changeset description using: `docs:`, `feature:`, `chore:` or `bugfix:`.
5. Changeset `.md` files are added to the `/.changeset` directory.
6. Commit and push the the new changeset file.
