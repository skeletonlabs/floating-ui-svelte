 *
 * When these elements receive focus before we can remove the aria-hidden attribute, we need to
 * handle the focus in a way that does not cause an error to be logged.
 *
 * This function handles the focus of the guard element first by momentary removing the
 * `aria-hidden` attribute, focusing the guard (which will cause something else to focus), and then
 * restoring the attribute.
